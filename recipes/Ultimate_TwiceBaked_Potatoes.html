    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.</li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
        <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!</li>
    </ol>
